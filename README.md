# SocrataDataSetCommApp

## Description
"Application that accesses one of the BIGGEST Api I have seen until now, offering visualization of data through an Clean Architecture MVVM App"

The above description can be considered short, concise, maybe insufficient, that is true.. But it offers the user a clear, short, concise desciption on what this Application does. 
Socrata is one of the biggest DataSets that manages schools from America. From information related to school, as an institute, up to the point of analyzing the wxams and procentage each school has when it comes to SATs, this Application is in charge of interogating this dataSet...

But instead of storing unnecessary information for the requirements given, an algorithm is contructed as to **select** specifically the necessaty data.
If the user needs to see specific information about the SAT's the specific School took, he can easily do that. There is a catch, as not every school had takes SAT's. If that would be the case, the User would be immediately notified about the individual school not have taken them until that point in time.
